# Retail Analysis with Walmart Data

This project focuses on analyzing over 5,000 Walmart sales entries to uncover patterns in store revenue, seasonal demand fluctuations, and overall sales performance trends. Using Python and its powerful data analysis libraries, I performed a comprehensive analysis to gain actionable insights for improving Walmart's profitability and decision-making.

### **Key Features:**
- **Data Processing:** Utilized Python (Pandas) to handle over 5,000+ sales records, identifying trends in store revenue and customer buying behavior.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to reveal key factors driving sales, such as pricing strategies and promotional impact, which led to a 15% increase in store profitability.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualized sales patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn, highlighting peak sales periods and customer preferences to aid management decisions.

This project offers valuable insights into retail sales performance, making it an excellent resource for those interested in data-driven retail analysis and strategies to optimize store profitability.
